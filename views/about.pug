          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I took an interest in programming my freshman year of high school, and it just took off from there. I've had 4 years experience learning Java, however I was never the best at it. I've learned bits and pieces of multiple programming languages. I am most proficient in JavaScript, but I also have some knowledge and experience with Python, C++, and Java. I also know how to write HTML and CSS.
