          p I'm sure you've already seen my name somewhere on here, but if not, my name is Alec. And when i'm not working my fast food job, I study the many fassets of web development. I try to spend 2 - 3 hours per day after work studying. And something about myself that I consider to be a positive is my ability to not get frustrated when facing a problem. Because as we all know when you're new to web development, you run into a lot of errors in your code. Well, at least I did. When that happens you have to be able to stay calm and think level headed, because it seems that sometimes when you fix on error, 2 more appear.
